    "This online teaching resource on uncertainty and knowledge quality in science for policy starts with a general introduction to the challenges of interfacing science and policy regarding complex and contested issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, genetically modified crops, and environmental health risks of ambient particulate matter. It introduces the various [models of interfacing science and policy](https://proxy.eplanete.net/galleries/broceliande7/node/997/1584/grain) and their strengths and limitations and introduces the concept of [post normal science](https://proxy.eplanete.net/galleries/broceliande7/node/975/1584/grain).\n",

When variables are multiplied or divided, a “weak-link” principle is applied, and the minimum pedigree of all variables in the calculation is used as the pedigree of the result.  Pedigrees for subtraction and weighted averaging depend on whether the spread (S) of the variables is similar to the difference between them (D).\n",
