    "sensitivity analysis (UQSA). The material covers both epistemic (unknown and unquantifiable) uncertainty as well as stochastic uncertainty. This latter can be apportioned to the model input parameters through sensitivity analysis.\n",
    "After a general introduction on statistics and mathematical foundation, Global sensitivity analysis - the approach where all the parameters are varied at the same time - is presented in its variance-based form through the calculation of Sobol sensitivity indices. The use of meta-modelling for sensitivity analysis is also described through Polynomial Chaos. Finally, sensitivity auditing - an approach to check the normative frames of any\n",

Probability-distribution related models, response schedules and estimators are then detailed [here](models.ipynb). A precious tool for inference making such as generation of pseudo-random number is thoroughly discussed in [this notebook](pseudo-random.ipynb) along with its primary applications, _inter alia_ in the field of cryptography.

    "The sensitivity-analysis notebooks developed in this series aim at presenting further tools useful to students, modelers and practitioners from the quantitative-assessment field. Specifically, the use of the [Sobol sequence](sobol_interactive.ipynb) -or other low-discrepancy sequences- can be fundamental in case of computationally demanding models. This feature can be appreciated by testing the convergence pace of the Sobol sequence against a\n",
