    "\n",
    "In theory,\n",
    "that's fine. But in practice, $X$ is not really $U[0,1)$ but instead is derived\n",

    "power of 2, the distribution of $Y$ isn't uniform on $\\{1, \\ldots, m\\}$. For $m\n",
    "< 2^w$, the ratio of the largest to smallest selection probability \n",

    "#### More accurate method\n",
    "A better way to generate a (pseudo-)random integer on\n",
